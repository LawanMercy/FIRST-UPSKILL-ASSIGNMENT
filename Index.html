    <h1>A Brief Introduction About Myself</h1>
    <p>My name is Lawan Opeyemi Mercy, hails from Kogi state, I was born and raised in Lagos. I am the eldest and only daughter of the three kids of Mr. and Mrs. Lawan. I am a student, I am an athlete, and my hobbies include cooking, reading, learning new things, playing basketball, volunteering, singing, praying, traveling, to name a few. </p>
    
    <h2> My Background</h2>
    <p>I am currently taking my master's in business analytics, after graduating with a Bachelor of Science in financial management majoring in business administration. I am a complete novice in this field as my field is all about management and its principles, but I am willing to learn as much as possible, because I am somewhat fascinated by this field. </p>

    <h2>My Expectations from the Upskill '24 Program</h2>
    <p>A short story on how I got here before first. I feel in love with coding, or should I say tech out of curiosity and the urge to dive into something new, which is different from what I have been doing all my life. So, on this faithful day while strolling through my LinkedIn field, I saw this random post and I decided to see what it was about. On looking at it, it was the link to this program with full details of what it is about and what to expect, funny enough I even shared the signup link with a friend of mine. I was excited and decided to fill out the form even though I never expected to get feedback, talk more of a positive feedback, long story short, here I am learning web development, and I must say it has been a lovely process so far.
